### Command.csv

For *Add*, the input content format is:

- [Optional] For the rest columns, how many rest columns are vary, it depends on the value in the third column, it's in **[module].[Unit]** format.

```csv
a, Automation Test, 2, 1.2, 2.3

Example:
```csv
Learning Path::Custom.summary::<div>A list item in learning path summary:<ol><li>a</li><li>b</li></ol></div>
Learning Path::Custom.md_ms_author::qijiexue
Learning Path::Custom.md_ms_author::v-qixue
Module::Custom.products::windows
Module::Custom.summary::<div>A list item in module summary:<ol><li>a</li><li>b</li></ol></div>
Unit::Custom.durationInMinitues::100
Unit::Custom.md_description::<div>A list item in unit description:<ol><li>a</li><li>b</li></ol></div>
Test Case::System.Description::<p>test case description</p>
